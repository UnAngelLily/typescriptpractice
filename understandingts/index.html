        <h1>Core Types in Typescript</h1>
            <h5>
                number (1, 5.3, -10) = All numbers, no differentiation between intergres or floats<br/>
                string ('Hi', "Hi", `Hi`) = All text values<br/>
                boolean (true, false) = Just these two, no "truthy" or "falsy" values<br/>
            </h5>  
        Typescript adds extra steps to develop as a check. Will compile in to javascript.<br/>
        Make sure that app.ts and app.js are not open at the same time as it may cause duplications. They are viewed as the same file and may cause errors
